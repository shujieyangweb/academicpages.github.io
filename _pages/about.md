I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Harvard Medical School (Advisor: [Prof. Luke P. Lee](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/165825)). I received my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science from Duke University (Advisor: [Prof. Tony Jun Huang](https://acoustofluidics.pratt.duke.edu/people/tony-jun-huang)). My current research focus on Acoustofluidics, Lab on a Chip, BioMEMS and Biomedical Devices. I have authored/co-authored over 37 peer-reviewed articles in these fields. My articles have been cited more than 1,200 times, as documented at Google Scholar (h-index: 21). I am particularly interested in applying novel micro/nano technologies in biomedical engineering. I act as a reviewer for a number of journals, such as Lab on a Chip, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, IEEE Sensors Journal, and Microfluidics and Nanofluidics. My previous work has been featured in some popular media outlets, including Nature Materials, The Science Advisory Board, '2022 in science' by Wikipedia, Phys.org, and MIT Technology Review.
