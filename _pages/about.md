I will join the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at the University of Pennsylvania as a tenure-track Assistant Professor this August. 

I am currently serving as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow under the guidance of [Prof. Luke P. Lee](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/165825) at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science from Duke University, under the supervision of [Prof. Tony Jun Huang](https://acoustofluidics.pratt.duke.edu/people/tony-jun-huang). My research primarily focuses on Acoustics, Lab on a Chip, Acoustofluidics, and Biomedical Devices, with a particular interest in applying novel micro/nano technologies in the fields of mechanical engineering, materials science, and biomedical engineering. 

I have authored/co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed articles published in renowned journals such as _Nature Materials_, _Nature Protocols_, _Nature Communications_, _Science Advances_, _Small_, and _Lab on a Chip_, among others. My articles have received more than 1,900 citations as documented by Google Scholar (h-index: 26). And my work has been featured in various popular media outlets, such as _Nature Materials, The Science Advisory Board, '2022 in science' by Wikipedia, Phys.org, and MIT Technology Review_. I also serve as a reviewer for several esteemed journals, including _Lab on a Chip, IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, and Ultrasonics_.
